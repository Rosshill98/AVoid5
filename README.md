This script blocks you from commenting on reddit with the letter 'e'.

1. Install a userscript extension such as [greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (firefox) or [tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net) (chrome).

2. Then, [install the script](https://github.com/Rosshill98/aVoid5/raw/master/av5.user.js).

If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.
